Classification of protein-protein association rates based on biophysical informatics

This package contains an executable file predicting if the association rate of two binding partners in an input protein complex is higher than a predefined threshold. It also contains the list of 96 protein complexes in the benchmark set and their calculated association profiles used as input for the neural network model. The package offers an instruction and a demonstration example (PDB 7CEI) of how to obtain the prediction with the templates of both input and output files. The program work on a Linux platform and downloading is free for academic users.
